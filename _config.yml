          - <strong>Wildfire Image Processing:</strong> Transformed climate data (NC4 format) by Numpy to three-dimensional matrices including temporal and geospatial information. Performed matrix transformations to map the data into RGB 3-channel image arrays, enhancing the differentiation of burnt regions through intensified RGB color values to bolster the neural network's image recognition capabilities.
          - <strong>Feature Extraction and Image Convolution:</strong> Extracted 13 key features including precipitation, burnt area, tree coverage, population density, and lightning frequency. Employed convolution and average pooling techniques to capture neighboring pixel feature information to enrich feature representation. Implemented data imputation, normalization, dimensionality reduction, and tensor transformation to optimize model input.
          - <strong>Neural Networks Modeling:</strong> Constructed DNN and CNN using PyTorch, with the Tanh activation function and MSE loss function. Integrated Dropout layers to avoid overfitting. Achieved 75% accuracy on the validation set with the Convolutional DNN model, marking a 5% improvement over normal neural networks. Plans are underway to explore the use of Transformer and RNN architectures to further enhance model performance.
          - <strong>Model Interpretability and Attribution:</strong> Analyzed attributions on the input features of the established neural network models, assessing the contribution of factors such as temperature, wind speed, and geographic location to wildfire predictions. Identified that wind force, fuel load, and the previous year's burnt area (seasonality factor) have significant contributions to wildfire forecasting.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.
